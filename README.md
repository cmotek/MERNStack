This is a small work journal for the above-referenced guide. I'm currently working on the Data Layer chapters. I have created a database and collection in MongoDB Atlas, and I have connected to via Compass and MongoDB Shell. When I start to actually build the project, this is the repository it will inhabit.

Completed Data Layer Chapter: Uploaded documents to database via Mongo Shell. Utilized MongoDB Compass and created an index and an alert in MongoDB Atlas. Service Layer next.

Working on Service Layer Chapter. It's a bit frustrating because I don't think this book, released in 2018? includes examples in ES6 Javascript. So I'm having to mess with the examples in order to get them to run a little bit. I'm in kind of an overview section before I get into to working on the actual application build for the book, but I'd still like to work through the little code samples. It's funny how perilous learning from a book can be versus just trying to create something on your own from scratch. And it's not even the author's fault. These technologies move and change so quickly. 

Update: I was totally incorrect in my assessment of the example that I was having an error with and the author himself was kind enough to repond to an email inquiry from me. What a wild day.
